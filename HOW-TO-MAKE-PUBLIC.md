## Troubleshooting

### Can't See "Change Visibility" Button?
- **Check**: Are you the repository owner?
- **Check**: Are you logged into GitHub?
- **Check**: Did you scroll all the way down?

### Repository Name Confirmation Fails?
- Try: `aleks131/Bachelor-Project` (without dash)
- Try: `Bachelor-Project` (just the name)
- Check for typos

### Still Shows Private After Change?
- Wait 1-2 minutes (GitHub needs time to update)
- Refresh the page
- Clear browser cache
- Try incognito mode
